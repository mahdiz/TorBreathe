Detecting Blocked Bridge: Yeah, it's cheap and can be performed regularly.  And it can (arguably)
be done in a way that doesn't reveal the bridges themselves.

Yes, all you would have to do is announce a fake IP address and port
number

I remember maybe 2-3 years ago hearing or reading somewhere that the
following problem was something the Tor project was interested in:
namely, an algorithm to distribute bridges so that the chances of a user
receiving a working bridge is maximized and the probability of bridges
getting blocked is minimized, with some other useful properties like
finding out which gmail addresses are collecting bridges to block so
those addresses can be blacklisted, and so on.

Is this still a relevant problem that the Tor project is interested in
seeing a theoretical (but hopefully realistic) analysis of?  (If coding
up a new bridge distribution strategy based on the analysis were helpful
we could do that, too.  Also, I realize that active probing and DPI are
also problems for bridges, but I consider those to be separate
problems.)
